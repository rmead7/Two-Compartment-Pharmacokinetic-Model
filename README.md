# Two-Compartment-Pharmacokinetic-Model
Pharmacokinetics are modeled by separating physiological systems into compartments. The unique
physiological compartments describe the absorption, distribution and elimination of the varying methods of drug intake into a physiological system. The compartment model that is analyzed is an open Two-Compartment model that describes the absorption, distribution and elimination of a single intravenous drug dose. The compartments and their rate constants can be characterized where x1 is the concentration of the drug dose in the Central Compartment containing blood and extracellular water, x2 is the concentration of the Tissue Compartment, k01 is the rate constant of the drug dose being eliminated from the system, k21 is the rate constant of the drug dose being distributed from the Central Compartment to the Tissue Compartment and k12 is the rate constant of the drug dose that is being distributed from the Tissue Compartment to the Central Compartment.
